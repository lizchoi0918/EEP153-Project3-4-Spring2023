### Topic
This project explores the nutritional adequacy of families in Bukidnon, Philippines. By analyzing the demand fod food in this region, we will be designing effective policies to improve nutritional inadequacies. Based on the implications from dietary choices based on prices of food items and household budgets, we can manipulate nutritional outcomes by changing these variables. By utilizing this fact, we can assess the cost of the policy being proposed that impacts prices and budget. 
Main goals:
- Design a demand and nutrient function to estimate the variables for varying food types as a function of prices, budgets and household characteristics.
- Anlayze the critical nutritional inadequacies of the general population in Bukidnon, Philippines. 
- Develop a policy goal to combat the nutritional challenge, simulate the policy to observe its impact and asses its cost.
- Consruct a demand model to analyze type of food demand in Bukidnon, Philippines.
